# Go Dotprompt Library Usage Example

This directory contains sample code demonstrating how to use the `dotprompt` library in Go.

## File Structure

- `example.prompt`: The prompt definition file. It defines metadata with YAML front matter and the template in the body.
- `main.go`: An executable program that reads, parses, and renders `example.prompt` and outputs the result.

## How to Run

1.  Change the current directory to `go/example`.
    ```bash
    cd go/example
    ```

2.  Tidy the dependencies.
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3.  Run the program.
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## Output

When you run the program, the metadata from the `.prompt` file and the messages after applying the data will be displayed on standard output.
