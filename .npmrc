# Disabling pnpm [hoisting](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#hoist) by setting `hoist=false` is recommended on
# projects using rules_js so that pnpm outside of Bazel lays out a node_modules tree similar to what
# rules_js lays out under Bazel (without a hidden node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules). See
# https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/blob/7377f2d0387cc2a9251137929b1c53ccdb3fbcf0/docs/npm_import.md#npm_translate_lock
# documentation for more information.
hoist=false

# Not enabling this because it causes issues with sandboxing.
#
# and introduces errors when building Next.js applications.
# Otherwise, you'd run into errors such as:
#
#   node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1148
#     throw err;
#     ^
#
#   Error: Cannot find module './node-polyfill-crypto'
#   Require stack:

#shared-workspace-lockfile=false

#engine-strict = true
