"""Utilities for resolving tools and partials.

A well-defined object resolver is a callable that takes a name and returns
either an object or an awaitable (such as a future or coroutine) that returns an
object.

## Key Operations

| Function              | Description                                                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `resolve`             | Core async function to resolve a named object using a given resolver.      |
|                       | Handles both sync/async resolvers and sync functions returning awaitables. |
| `resolve_tool`        | Helper async function specifically for resolving tool names.               |
| `resolve_partial`     | Helper async function specifically for resolving partial names.            |
| `resolve_json_schema` | Helper async function specifically for resolving JSON schemas.             |

The `resolve` function handles both sync and async resolvers. If the resolver is
sync, it is run in a thread pool to avoid blocking the event loop. If the
resolver is async, it is awaited directly.

The `resolve_*` functions are convenience wrappers around `resolve` that handle
the specific types of resolvers for tools, partials, and schemas.
